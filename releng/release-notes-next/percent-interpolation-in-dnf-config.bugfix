Mock parses the DNF configuration specified in `config_opts["dnf.conf"]` itself
to perform some post-processing tasks, such as bind-mounting the on-host repo
directories into the bootstrap chroot based on this DNF config.  In previous
versions of Mock, there was an issue where it failed to parse the DNF config if
some of the DNF options contained the '%' symbol.  This was due to Python's
ConfigParser raising an %-interpolation exception that was ignored but Mock, but
resulting in Mock ignoring the rest of the config file and finishing without
performing the mentioned bind-mounts.  This bug has been fixed, and the '%' sign
is no longer considered to be a special Python ConfigParser character.
