When bootstrap chroot is initialized from downloaded container image, it
typically contains `/etc/rpm/macros.image-language-conf` file with locale
filtering of some kind (per defaults from the fedora-kickstarts project).
This bootstrap configuration though affects the buildroot installation
(filtering l11n files from buildroot) and this is sometimes unexpected.
Mock now [automatically removes the macro file][PR#1189], see
[issue#1181][] for more info.
