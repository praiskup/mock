The `root_cache` plugin is designed to invalidate the cache tarball whenever the
corresponding Mock configuration changes (any file in the list
`config_opts['config_paths']` changes).  This cache invalidation mechanism had
been broken since Mock v3.2 when we rewrote the configuration file loader and
inadvertently broke the `config_opts['config_paths']`.  The config loader [has
now been fixed][PR#1322], and the cache invalidation works again as expected.
