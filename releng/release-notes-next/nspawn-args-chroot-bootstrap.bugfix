Previously, the `nspawn_args` configuration value was not applied in multiple
internal `doChroot()` calls.  This could cause issues when custom nspawn
arguments were needed everywhere (see [PR#1410][]).  Now, `doChroot()`
automatically applies `nspawn_args`, shifting the responsibility from callers to
callee.
