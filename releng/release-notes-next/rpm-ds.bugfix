The `--installdeps foo.spec` feature is implemented using the RPM Python API.
Previously we used the method `hdr.dsFromHeader()` to get the list of
`BuildRequires`.  This method has been removed from the Python RPM API (rpm
v4.19) in favor of the long-enough existing `rpm.ds(hdr, ...)` method.  Mock
[has started using `rpm.ds()` API call][PR#1223] to fix the [`AttributeError:
'rpm.hdr' object has no attribute 'dsFromHeader'`][issue#1203] traceback on
newer systems (e.g. Fedora 40+).
