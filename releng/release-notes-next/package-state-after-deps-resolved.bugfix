The `installed_pkgs.log` — generated by the `package_state` plugin — was
[previously generated too early][issue#1429], after the static build
requirements were installed but **before** the dynamic build requirements were
resolved and installed. This led to incorrect chroot introspection for the end
user, as the reported set of packages needed to build the given package was
incomplete.  The new Mock version generates the `installed_pkgs.log` file after
the dynamic build requirements are installed.
